Enhances your quality of life by transferring your Spotify playlists to TIDAL.  
Bridging the gap in the music streaming wars, one playlist at a time.

Probably not.

But did I enjoy building it? :)

- [ ] Improve search functionality for missing tracks  
- [ ] Optimize the sync process for TIDAL tracks  
- [ ] Make TIDAL tracks persist across syncs  
- [ ] Fully integrate TIDAL playlist track downloads

### Credits  
This project began as a fork of [spotify_to_tidal](https://github.com/spotify2tidal), combined with the [python-tidal algorithm](https://github.com/tamland/python-tidal).  
It was built for personal use and learning purposes. There is an automation feature that uses [tidal-media-downloader](https://github.com/yaronzz/Tidal-Media-Downloader).  
Thanks to everyone involved!
